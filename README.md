# ConsentStack CMP
**Open source, developer focused & human centric consent management platform.**

**NOTE:** This repository is a public version of the product available [here](https://consentstack.org/), and previously developed by [OrbisLabs](https://github.com/orbislabs). The code is being prepared for its debut into the open source world, however we welcome any votes of interest, please submit a comment or even just a :+1: on this [issue](https://github.com/ConsentStack/cmp/issues/1).

## Motivation

Whilst exploring the Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) which are available both open and closed source, it was a striking fact that the goal was to drive the highest possible consent / opt-in rates. An [article published by Digiday](https://digiday.com/media/tech-publisher-future-getting-95-percent-audience-consent-ad-tracking/), explained how the publishing group [Future](https://www.futureplc.com/), achieved a 95% opt-in rate through the optimisation and usage of [dark patterns](https://darkpatterns.org/) in their consent modal. 

There was no thought given to the soft squidgy animals at the other end of the screen. Therefore this projects main aims are:
* Educate people on data harvesting on the web.
* Provide fine grained controls, over that data.
* Create a dialog between the user and the website owner.
* Achieve this through a pleasent user experience.

To help drive the main goals, we have decided to target the developer community to drive adoption of such tooling and use the community to help understand how best to address the web privacy issue.

## Alternative Options (Open Source)

Below are a list of some open source variants of the CMP, which exist today - most likely this list will be expanded with further information and moved into its own repository.

* [Axel Springer - OIL.js](https://github.com/as-ideas/oil)
* [Segment.io - Consent Manager](https://github.com/segmentio/consent-manager)
